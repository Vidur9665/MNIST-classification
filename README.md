# MNIST-classification

I made a neural network for image classification using the MNIST dataset. I started by using a base neural network where the model trained and tested itself in batches of 128 images and had 6 epochs. This model obtained an accuracy of 97% (the code was obtained using a guide from tensorflowâ€™s official website). Then, I wanted to increase its accuracy, so I decided to try using a CNN. I used ChatGPT to help me create a CNN that included 2 convolution layers (both having a reLU function and a max-pooling function) and 1 dense layer. The layers in this network also had a dropout rate of 25% per convolution layer and 50% in the dense layer to prevent overfitting, and the ADAM optimizer was used to further assist the model. This model obtained a final testing accuracy of 99.4%.
